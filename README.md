# ClickSaver
ClickSaver for Anarchy Online

This is an *unofficial* fork of ClickSaver (if you want to call the current situation as *official*) based on the latest available sources from AOU [1] and Darkbane [2].


## Compilation

VS2022 with the toolchain set to v141_xp to get CS to still run under WinXP additonal to all newer Windows versions.
The solution should still work in all VS versions down to VS2010 if the toolset is changed to the latest version supported by that version.


## Quick history tour

From what I could gather these were the official places/developers you could get CS from in the past. While lots of others contributed fixes and ideas throughout the lifetime. Correct me if I'm wrong.

  - Only hosts the sources and binaries for v2.3.5 (not sure where it actually comes from), which needs updates from Darkbane to run with the current version of AO.
  - Currently considered to be the official version together with the replacement binaries from Darkbane below.
